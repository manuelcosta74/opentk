# opentk
OpenTK is a set of bindings to OpenGL, OpenCL and OpenAL. This is not the main repository, it extendes OpenTK for Android to work with a dedicated rendering execution context. To do so, we used a specific looper (BackgroundLooper) that extends SynchronizationContext class.
It is important to note that SynchronizationContext is the fundamental component of the async / await patern. For details, you can check [Parallel Programming with .Net - ExecutionContext vs SynchronizationContext](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/pfxteam/archive/2012/06/15/executioncontext-vs-synchronizationcontext.aspx)  
When the Activity is Paused or Stopped surface and window are destroyed and to prevent loosing OpenGL context, AndroidGameView detaches it from the window and Surface (for details, please, look at this [discussion](http://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/621/androidgameview-pause-without-losing-gl-context/p2).  
To guarantee that no OpenGL calls are made when the Activity is Paused or Stopped, we created an interface (IExecutionContext) with method Pause to stop the execution of the looper and Resume to reinitialize the execution of queued methods. This interface is used by AndroidGameView and Rendering_ExecutionContext_Android is an implementation that we provide that essentially do a set of other things on top of BackgroundLooper.
